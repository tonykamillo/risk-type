# Custom Risk Type

Proposal to allow insurers create your own risk types.
The approach consists in attach generic fields and values in order to define a risk, it's seems like a metadata tagging.
There are three main models, one that hold risk type itself and anothers two hold field/value pair that going to be related to a risk type.
